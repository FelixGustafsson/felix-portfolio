Soon to be Fullstack developer from Lund, Sweden with solid knowledge in web development. Currently studying at Teknikhögskolan in Lund.\n

I'm Currently living outside of Malmö, Sweden with my two cats. I've always had a passion for technology and especially programming since I was 10. That's when my grandpa gave me my first book about C# and I was immediately hooked. Since then, I've taught myself many languages and software to become the ultimate tech warrior.\n

Right now, I'm looking for a job as a frontend developer in order to get som hands on experience from working in the industry but also to grow as a developer.\n

Aside from tech, I love hunting, being outdoors in the forest and playing golf.`
