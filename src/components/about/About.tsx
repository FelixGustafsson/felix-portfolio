        I'm Currently living in Lund, Sweden. I've always had a passion for
        technology and especially programming since I was 13. That's when my
        grandpa gave me my first book about C++ and I was immediately hooked.
        Since then, I've taught myself many languages and software in my quest
        to become the best of the best.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aside from tech, I love hunting, cooking, playing
        golf, and skiing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I'm a freelance web developer and graphic designer.
