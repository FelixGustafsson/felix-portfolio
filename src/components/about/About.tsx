                I'm Currently living in Lund, Sweden. I've always had a passion for technology and especially programming since I was 10. That's when my grandpa gave me my first book about C++ and I was immediately hooked. Since then, I've taught myself many languages and software to become the ultimate tech warrior.
                <br />
                <br />
                Right now, I'm looking for a job as a frontend developer in order to get hands on experience from working in the industry but also to grow as a developer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Aside from tech, I love hunting, being outdoors in the forest, playing golf, and skiing.</p>
